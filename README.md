# ErocPaperScissors

A small Postgress->Node->Angular web-app in which AI plays games of Rock Paper Scissors against visiting users.

The back end tracks every hand played by all players, building a database of move patterns and establishing a statistical record of throws.

The algorithm has a better than random chance of winning against a non-random(human) opponent and appears to quickly learn players strategies in an organic way.

There is no cheating involved and the next hand is chosen as soon as the previous hand has been selected.
